# Dr. Vaibhav Garg

I am a Collegiate Assistant Professor in Computer Science at [Virginia Tech’s Innovation Campus](https://innovationcampus.vt.edu/). I earned my Ph.D. from NC State University in 2024. My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly toward building systems that enable **AI for social good**.

I focus on studying social media discourse, such as:
- Understanding narratives used in hate and inciting speech
- Analyzing mental health support-seeking behavior online
- Promoting responsible computing and computational social science

I’ve served as a reviewer for top-tier venues including **ACL**, **ICWSM**, and **ACM TIST**. I deeply value mentoring and advising students passionate about ethical AI and applied NLP.
